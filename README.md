# DailyNotes

DailyNotes - Inside the Daily Notes folder, every day synced with the current time of the laptop, a new note with today's date is created. Once the app is installed, it runs continuously and never shuts off. The app automates this task for me, but I have made it public on GitHub with steps for setting it up to help others who want to do the same because I find it useful.

- [ ] app checks if DailyNotes folder exists in apple notes and if not it creates one 
- [ ] app runs synced with current local time every day 00:01 and creates a new note with the date of today as header
- [ ] is configured such as that app is starting every time mac launches - basically no probability that the app is not running every day
- [ ] its a real application in dmg format
- [ ] contains exact steps to make it running on mac
